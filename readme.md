# Profile Component Coding Test
Please code the attached design. Feel free to use any tools you feel necessary.

## Requirements
- Responsive & scaleable
- Code the component as if it could be used multiple times on a single page.
- Write your CSS in a way that would allow the content to grow or shrink if the content were to change.
- Add an action of your choice with JS on click of the 'follow' button. We prefer vanilla JS.

## What We're Looking For
- High quality front end code. Simple, well written, organized, and clean code.
- Strong attention to visual detail. (Hints: background color around the component, rounded corner radius, etc.).
- We want to see your CSS skills. Please avoid Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks.
- Use of modern web standards.

### Bonus Points
- Include build files (SASS/SCSS/LESS etc.).
- If this challenge seems simple and you complete quickly, feel free to add extras to 'show off' something you're excited about.

### Images
If you do not have Photoshop or are unable to extract the cover photo and profile image, feel free to use your own graphics. Alternatively can also easily grab and image from http://placekitten.it or http://placedog.com/.
